# Star Wars Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions about the Star Wars universe. The system combines a retriever that fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base with a language model that generates answers based on these documents. The core components include embeddings for vector representations, a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval, and a conversational retrieval chain.

### Contributions
This project has been developed as a class project for the course **Natural Language Processing**, taught by **Dr. Giorgio Satta**, at the University of Padua, in June 2024.
The contributors are **Shabnam Zareshahraki** and **Joseph Fiume**.

## Running the System
The project is maintained as a Jupyter Notebook, thus, run the notebook from the beginning to the end to see the results. The whole notebook is commented and self-contained.
